🍲 Local Food Wastage Management System

📌 Overview

Food wastage is a global problem, with millions of tons wasted annually while many people face hunger. This project aims to reduce food waste by connecting surplus food providers (restaurants/individuals) with receivers (NGOs/individuals).

-Store & manage food listings (CSV → Database).

-Match providers with receivers based on food type & city.

-Track surplus food distribution and expiry trends.

-Display insights via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
